# Maps — choropleths over the shipped GeoJSON

> This page is a stub: the examples below are live, the full write-up is still to come.

Maps go through the ECharts layer: `d=` carries a plain JSON option, and the
GeoJSON for the regions ships with the service.

## 1. The regions that ship with the service

| `map=` | region |
| --- | --- |
| `USA` | the 50 states + DC |
| `CN` | the Chinese provinces |
| `EU` | the 27 EU member states |
| `JP` | the 47 prefectures |
| `BR` | the Brazilian states |
| `AU` | the Australian states |
| `DE` | the 16 German Länder |
| `KR` | the 17 Korean administrative regions |

## 2. Parameters

| param | meaning | default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `d=` | the ECharts option as JSON | — |
| `w=` / `h=` | minimum width / height | natural size |

## 3. Pitfalls

- **`series[].map` names the region**, not the country: `USA`, `CN`, `EU` …
  An unknown name is a 400.
- **`data[].name` must match the region names in the GeoJSON** — for the US the
  full state names (`California`, `New York`), for China the short forms
  (`北京`, `广东`).
- **The projection is already applied** — if you set `aspectScale`, keep it at
  `1`, or the map comes out squashed.
